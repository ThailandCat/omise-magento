## Enabling Omise Module
In order to enable **Omise Payment Gateway** in checkout page, you have to enable omise-magento module from Magento's configuration page, in payment method section.  

1. In admin page. Go to `Omise` > `Module Setting` (from the top menu). It will lead you to the Magento's payment method configuration page.

3. In some business models you may need to capture the charge at a later time. For example, when you can capture the charge only when you have the product in stock or before shipping. In that case, during checkout Omise will only authorize and hold the charge.  *You can hold a charge for as long as permitted by the issuing bank. This delay may vary between cards from 1 to 30 days depending on each card.*

The 2 available options for **Payment Action** are `Authorize only` or `Authorize and Capture`.
